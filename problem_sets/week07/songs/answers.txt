reflection

1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
- I would weigh factors such as songs genre, energy, tempo, mood, tone, and danceability, particularly focusing on the top 100 songs a person listens to.

2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

- People's musical tastes are always evolving, influenced by their moods and contexts at the time of listening. Therefore, and individual's preferences may shift frequently. To accurately calcurate an audio aura, I would analyze comprehensive data on a person's listening habits, ensuring consistency in the data collection to enhance accuracy. By considering the variability in mood and context, the results will better reflect the true audio aura of the individual.
