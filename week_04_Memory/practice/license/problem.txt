Background
    Suppose you work for a company that develops AI-enhanced license plate recognition technology. As you develop your technology, you may want to use actual license plate numbers as test data. You have a text file with some plate numbers you want to analyze, so you first try reading from that text file and printing out the license plates, to test your file-reading logic. But when you run your program, only the last number prints 8 times! What went wrong?
